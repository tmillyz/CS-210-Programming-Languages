# This file is and integrated program using CPP and Python code to produce an inventory program for CornerGrocer.
# The project consists of a main menu that allows a user to choose from 4 options and search for items in inventory
# then those items, if available, will display the amount available to the screen.
# The items are read from a text file using Python.
# The functions for reading and writing to the list are in the python code and CPP is used to create the menu.
# I found that Python was the most difficult for me but mostly because I had issues with integrating it with CPP and getting
# the libraries to work.
# I think the program worked well and was a simple design.  Visually it's not appealing but does what it is supposed to do.
# I also need to work on my inline comments, and comments in general because I left some things out that would have made collaboration
# much easier had I not. 
# This program taught me that patience and critical thinking are required to succeed in this type of field.
